    "# Build a Spam Classifier using Machine Learning and ElasticSearch.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the trec07_spam set of documents annotated for spam, available “data resources”. \n",
    "First read and accept agreement at http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/treccorpus07/. Then download the 255 MB Corpus (trec07p.tgz). The html data is in data/; the labels (\"spam\" or \"ham\") are in full/.\n",
    "\n",
    "Index the documents with ElasticSearch, but use library to clean the html into plain test first. You dont have to do stemming or skipping stopwords (up to you); eliminating some punctuation might be useful. \n",
    "Cleaning Data is Required: By \"unigram\" we mean an English word, so as part of reading/processing data there will be a filter step to remove anything that doesnt look like an English word or small number. Some mistake unigrams passing the filter are acceptable, if they look like words (e.x. \"artist_\", \"newyork\", \"grande\") as long as they are not overwhelming the set of valid unigrams. You can use any library/script/package for cleaning, or share your cleaning code (but only the cleaning code) with the other students.\n",
    "Make sure to have a field “label” with values “yes” or “no” (or \"spam\"/\"ham\") for each document.\n",
    "Partition the spam data set into TRAIN 80% and TEST 20%. One easy way to do so is to add to each document in ES a field \"split\" with values either \"train\" or \"test\" randomly, following the 80%-20% rule. Thus there will be 2 feature matrices, one for training and one for testing (different documents, same exact columns/features). The spam/ham distribution is roughly a third ham and two thirds spam; you should have a similar distribution in both TRAIN and TEST sets."
